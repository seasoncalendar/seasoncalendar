### Features and Bugfixes

The logic behind the app is still quite simple, so that I'm probably able to implement feature requests/adjustments rather quickly if you can't/don't want to implement it yourself.

Otherwise:

1. Grab and resolve an issue
2. Create a pull request
3. ???
4. Profit :grin:

### Adding food data

Perhaps the best thing about this seasonal foods calendar is its potential to provide information for people all around the globe.
However, in order to increase its reach, new languages, foods and regions have to be added continuously. A description on how to do this is provided in the respective issues:

- Languages: [Issue #36](https://github.com/seasoncalendar/seasoncalendar/issues/36)
- Foods: [Issue #29](https://github.com/seasoncalendar/seasoncalendar/issues/29)
- Regions: [Issue #47](https://github.com/seasoncalendar/seasoncalendar/issues/47)
