A practical and easy to use app showing you which kinds of fruit, vegetables, salads etc. are in season right now.

Foods that are produced regionally are often times cheaper, tastier and better for the environment due to a shorter and more convenient transport.

## Features

There certainly are similar apps out there, especially within the German-speaking community.

However some distinguishing features are:

- Huge database
  - Over 100 different kinds of foods and their availability ([contribute and improve information](https://github.com/Flunzmas/seasoncalendar/issues/29))
- Save favorite foods
- Modern design
- No Advertisement & No Tracking (never!)
- Runs on a variety of android devices (Android 4.1 or newer)
- [Multiple languages](https://github.com/Flunzmas/seasoncalendar/issues/36) (and coming soon [multiple regions](https://github.com/Flunzmas/seasoncalendar/issues/47))
- Free Open Source Software

Especially the open-source aspect is a main motivating factor for me to further develop this app.

Additional info can be fetched from my website: [flunzmas.com/seasonal-foods-calendar](https://flunzmas.com/seasonal-foods-calendar)

## Asset Sources

The database file `assets/db/foods.db` contains all food information and their respective sources. You can open the file e.g. with [the official SQLite DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).

Please note that the data concerning foods' availability partly stems from [lebensmittellexikon.de](https://lebensmittellexikon.de/) and thus is __not__ subject to the GPL license. I kindly ask you to contact me before re-using the availability data (columns starting with 'av' from the file `assets/db/foods.db`).
